## Break Before User Code Starts

The labs-1 folder contains an `app.js` file. Start `app.js` with Node in Inspect Mode, but with
the application immediately paused on the first line of executable code.

If this task is performed correctly, the program should be paused on line 5. This can be verified
by connecting Chrome Devtools to the Inspector via the [ chrome://inspect ] URL, finding the
process under `Remote Targets`, clicking `inspect` and ensuring the `Sources` tab is selected.
