## Setting a Break Point Using a Code keyword

The labs-2 folder has an `app.js` file, edit the file so that when started in Inspect mode it will
pause in the first line of the f function.

To verify, start the `app.js` file in Inspect mode (without breaking before user code starts).
Connect Chrome Devtools, and ensure the `Sources` tab is selected. All being well, the
application should be paused at line 2.
