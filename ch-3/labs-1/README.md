## Stack Size

In the labs-1 folder there is a file called `will-throw.js`. Run the file without any flags, and
then run the file with `--stack-trace-limit` set to 200.

In the first case, there should only be ten stack frames in the error output.

In the second case, there should be more than ten frames in the error in output.
