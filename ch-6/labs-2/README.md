## Install a Dependency Using Semver Range

The labs-2 folder contains a `package.json` file.

Install the following dependencies at the specified version ranges, and ensure that those ranges
are correctly specified in the `package.json` file:

● Install `fastify` at greater than or equal to 2.0.0, while accepting all future MINOR and
PATCH versions
● Install `rfdc` at exactly version 1.1.3

Run `npm install` to install the development dependency required to validate this exercise,
and then run `npm test` in the labs-2 folder to check that the task has been completed

If output says `passed` then the task was completed correctly
